In India, it is still a struggle for the deaf people to communicate and
have access to education due to the presence of only a handful of schools
with sign language interpreters. It, therefore, becomes a major concern
to pave a way for the deaf people that would not only minimize the gap
in communication but also make them independent through a platform
that ensures self education and learning of sign language.

## Why Indian Sign Language?

Extensive work has been done on American sign language recognition
but Indian sign language differs significantly from American sign
language. The dire situation regarding sign language in India and the
minimal work put forth on ISL needs to be looked upon, which is what
provided the motivation to work on an android application that is easily
accessible, easy to use and has the potential to bridge the communication
gap and resolve the current educational limitations.
